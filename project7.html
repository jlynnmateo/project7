<h2>A person I admire <br /> (past or present)</h2>
  <p>A person I admire would be an author named J.R.R. Tolkien because I like the way he 
  writes about his characters. He writes about the characters in a different way.
  The following link shows more information about Tolkien and
  his other books.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien" target="_blank">More About Tolkien</a>
